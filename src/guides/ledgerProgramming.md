# Programming a Ledger Nano

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to use the `@bitcoinerlab` modules to interact with the Ledger Nano device and perform a multi-signature transaction. This guide assumes that you already know what a descriptor, miniscript, and the policy language are. Please, refer to the [Guide on Miniscript](/guides/miniscript-vault) if you are not familiar with these concepts. The focus of this guide is on the Ledger programming part and multi-signature transactions.

## What You Will Learn

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Set up and use @bitcoinerlab modules with Ledger Nano devices
- Create and manage Bitcoin descriptors
- Sign multi-signature transactions using Ledger and software wallets
- Finalize and broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network
